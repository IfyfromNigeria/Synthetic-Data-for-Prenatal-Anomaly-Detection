The dataset used in this study is the Shenzhen foetal ultrasound dataset, originally collected from Shenzhen People’s Hospital for the purpose of assessing whether AI can identify intracranial foetal structures between gestational weeks 11-14 (Cui & Dong, 2022). This dataset directly aligns with the research’s objective of investigating nuchal translucency (NT) as a relevant marker for trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) screening.
